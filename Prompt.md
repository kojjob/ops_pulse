## 1. Core Concept

OpsPulse is your e-commerce store's live heartbeat. More than just another analytics dashboard, it's a real-time command center that makes your data feel alive. Experience the excitement of seeing a sale happen the moment it occurs, and the confidence of knowing exactly what's happening on your store—right now.

## 2. Target Audience

**Persona Example:**

Sarah, 32, runs a growing online boutique for handmade jewelry. She's passionate about her products but overwhelmed by the "business" side of things. She needs information that is instant, clear, and actionable. She doesn't have time for complex reports or jargon—she wants to glance at a screen and know.

## 3. Brand Personality & Tone

- **Instant:** Fast, responsive, immediate
- **Clear:** Simple, uncluttered, easy to understand
- **Reliable:** Always on, accurate, dependable
- **Empowering:** Makes the user feel in control and smart

**Copywriting Tone:** Confident, clear, helpful, and direct. Avoid corporate jargon. Use active voice. For example, instead of "Leverage real-time data streams," say "See every sale as it happens."

## 4. Visual Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Deep, trustworthy blue `#1e40af` (reliability, professionalism)
- **Secondary:** Vibrant, energetic green `#10b981` (positive growth, new orders, success)
- **Accent:** Bright, attention-grabbing orange `#f59e0b` (alerts, notifications, CTAs)
- **Neutrals:** Range of grays `#f3f4f6` to `#111827` (text, backgrounds, borders)

### Typography
- **Headings:** Inter or Poppins, bold, clean
- **Body:** Inter, regular weight, highly readable at small sizes
- **Data/Metrics:** Monospaced font (JetBrains Mono or SF Mono) for numbers, ensuring consistent alignment and a technical feel

### Layout & UI Elements
- **Dashboard:** Grid-based layout. Key metrics ("KPI cards") should be large and prominent. Use cards to group related information.
- **Data Visualization:** Clean, simple line charts for trends. Use primary/secondary colors for positive/negative trends. Avoid 3D charts or unnecessary decorations.
- **Iconography:** Consistent icon set (e.g., Heroicons, pairs well with TailwindCSS). Style should be outlined and minimal.

## 5. Key Messaging & Value Proposition

- **Tagline:** Your E-commerce Mission Control, Live.
- **Primary Value Proposition:** Stop refreshing your dashboard. See your sales, visitors, and trends update in real-time.
- **Secondary Value Propositions:**
	- The fastest way to know what's happening in your store
	- All your critical metrics on one beautiful, live screen
	- Built for busy store owners who value their time

## 6. Key Screens to Design

- **Landing Page:** Clearly communicate the value proposition with a live demo GIF/video. Feature testimonials and pricing.
- **Onboarding Flow:** Simple, step-by-step process to connect the first store.
- **Main Dashboard:** The core product. A visually stunning, real-time view of the metrics.
- **Settings/Integrations Page:** Clean interface for managing connections and alerts.
